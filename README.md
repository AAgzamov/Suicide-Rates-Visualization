# Data Visualization utilizng Python programming language.

This repository is a course project on completing an American Center Tashkent Python Data Visualization Course.
The topic of the project is Suicide Rates Comparison.

This repository consists of the README.md file, a Python file with the scripts, and the CSV files with a reliable data we need in order to visualize the data on different graphs.

The visualization is done thanks to the 'matplotlib', 'pandas', 'numpy' Python modules.

# Instruction

In order to understand the project, you will need to have the graphs on your machine and refer to the README.md file to know what each of the graphs depicts.

Follow the steps:
1. Download the repository in your machine. You can do that either using GUI or running the 'git clone https://github.com/AAgzamov/Team2_SuicideRates.git' command in your shell.
2. Run the 'graphs.py' file on your machine.
You will need Pyhton installed on your machine to run the 'graphs.py' file. If you do not have it, you can download it from https://www.python.org/.
3. Once you have run the 'graphs.py' successfully, several graphs (in PNG files) will appear in the same directory where the 'graphs.py' located.

Now, you can go over the grpahs and refer to the README.md file to understand what the graphs illustrate.

# Plan of the project

The project is dived into three parts. These are 'Introduction', 'Body', 'Conclusion'.

### 1. Introduction:

### 2. Body:
   - General suicide rate comparison among several countries **graph**.
   - Suicide rate comparison of the USA, Uzbekistan, and other countries (narrowed down) **graph**.
   - Suicide rate age **graph**.
   - Suicide rate by sex **graph**.
   - What has already been done to prevent suicide **info**. 

### 3. Conclusion:
   - Ways of decreasing suicide rate **info**.
