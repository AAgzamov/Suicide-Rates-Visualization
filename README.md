# Data Visualization utilizing Python programming language.

This repository is a course project on completing an American Center Tashkent Python Data Visualization Course.
The topic of the project is Suicide Rates Comparison.

This repository consists of the *README.md* file, a Python file with the scripts, and the *CSV* files with a reliable data we need in order to visualize the data on different graphs.

The visualization is done thanks to the *matplotlib*, *pandas*, and *numpy* Python modules.

# Instruction

In order to understand the project, you will need to have the graphs on your machine and refer to the *README.md* file to know what each of the graphs depicts.

Follow the steps:
1. Download the repository in your machine. You can do that either using GUI or running the ```git clone https://github.com/AAgzamov/Suicide-Rates-Visualization.git``` command in your terminal.
2. Run the *graphs.py* file on your machine.
You will need Pyhton installed on your machine to run the *graphs.py* file. If you do not have it, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).
3. To execute *graphs.py* you will need to install packages (matplotlib, pandas, numpy). You can do that running ```pip3 install matpotlib```, then ```pip3 install pandas```, and finally ```pip3 install numpy``` in your terminal.
4. Once you have executed the *graphs.py* successfully, several graphs (in PNG files) will appear in the same directory where the *graphs.py* located.

Now, you can go over the graphs and refer to the *README.md* file to understand what the graphs illustrate.

# Plan of the project

The project is dived into three parts. These are **Introduction**, **Body**, and **Conclusion**.

### 1. Introduction:
   - **What is suicide and who is at risk?**
    Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death.
    According to a [website](https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html), suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. It was responsible for more than 47,500 deaths in 2019, which is about one death every 11 minutes. The number of people who think about or attempt suicide is even higher. In 2019, 12 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicide.
      While the link between suicide and mental disorders is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness.
In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners. By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt.
   
   - **Deaths by cause in the world, 1990 to 2017.**
    In *deaths-by-cause-world.png* file, you can see a set of bar charts that illustrates a share of deaths from injuries, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in percentage in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017. Injuries include road accidents, homicides, conflict deaths, drowning, fire-related accidents, natural disasters and suicides. NCDs are chronic, long-term illnesses, and communicable diseases are infectious diseases.
At a global level we see that the majority of deaths are caused by NCDs. As the world is making progress in the fight against many infectious diseases, it is expected that NCDs will become increasingly dominant as the cause of death.

### 2. Body:
   - **Share of deaths from suicide, 1990 to 2017.**
    In *deaths-from-suicide.png*, a line graph illustrates a share of deaths from suicide in percentage among Greenland, Grenada, Russia, South Korea, the USA, and Uzbekistan. Greenland has the highest suicide rate, while Grenada has the lowest rate. We can see that South Korea reaches its peak in nearly 2010.
   
   - **Narrowed down suicide rate comparison.**
    Here, in *uzb-us-kz-deaths.png*, is a bar chart that depicts information about share of deaths from suicide in percentage in Uzbekistan, the United States, and Kazakhstan in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017. We can see that Kazakhstan has significantly higher suicide rate compared with Uzbekistan and the USA.
   
   - **Suicide rates by age in Uzbekistan, 1990 and 2017.**
    *suicide-rates-by-age-uzb.png* has a horizontal bar chart that shows suicide rate among people aged over 70 years, from 50 to 69 years, 15 to 49 years, and kids aged from 5 to 14 years in Uzbekistan in 1990 and 2017. These rates are given as the number of suicide deaths per 100,000 people in Uzbekistan. 
    
   - **Suicide rate by sex by method in the USA, 2019.**
    *suicide-by-method-m-usa.png* and *suicide-by-method-f-usa.png* have pie charts that depict suicide rate of males by method and suicide rate of females by method in the USA in 2019 respectively. Rate is given in percentage. We can see that among all of the methods firearm is the most popular method for attempt a suicide. 
    
   - **Risk factors and interventions.**
    In *risk-factors-and-interventions.png*, there is a chart that summarizes the key risk factors for suicide aligned with relevant interventions. Its message is clear: to prevent suicide, interventions need to take place from the universal to the individual level.
    
### 3. Conclusion:
   - **Ways of decreasing suicide rate.**
    In order to decrease potential suicide attempts, several actions have to take place. These are strengthening economic support, creating protective environments, teaching coping with problems, identifying and supporting people at risk, etc.
